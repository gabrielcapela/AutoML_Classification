# Classification with AutoML

## **Fetal Health Classification**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Welcome to my project on classifying fetal health using PyCaret!

The well-being of both children and mothers is a global priority, with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasizing the importance of reducing child mortality and enhancing maternal healthcare. This project aims to build a Machine Learning model using AutoML to assess fetal health based on Cardiotocography data. The goal is to support healthcare providers by delivering a fast, reliable, and objective evaluation of fetal health, thus minimizing the risks of perinatal complications.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview
Pandas Profiling & PyCaret: Initially, I utilized Pandas Profiling to generate a detailed report of the dataset, offering insights into missing values, correlations, and data distributions. Then, I used PyCaret to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, including preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and detecting outliers), model comparison (compare_models()), hyperparameter tuning (tune_model()), and training the final model for predictions. The trained model was saved for later use.

## âš¡ Main Objective
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of PyCaret and Pandas Profiling, tools that enable both data scientists and newcomers to streamline their machine learning workflows with minimal effort. The focus is on automating tasks and speeding up model development while generating actionable insights.
