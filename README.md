# Classification with AutoML

## **Fetal Health Classification**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Welcome to my project on classification the fetal health insurance costs using PyCaret!

Child and maternal health are critical global concerns, with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasizing the need to reduce child mortality and improve maternal healthcare. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model using AutoML to classify fetal health based on Cardiotocography data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a fast, accurate, and objective evaluation of fetal well-being, reducing the risks of perinatal complications.

### ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Inside
**Pandas Profiling** & **PyCaret**: First, I used Pandas Profiling to generate a comprehensive report on the dataset, providing insights into missing values, correlations, and data distributions. Then, I used PyCaret to automate the entire machine learning process, including preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and detecting outliers), model comparison (compare_models()), model tuning (tune_model()), and training the final model for predictions. The model was saved for future use.

### âš¡ Main Goal
This projectâ€™s main objective is to showcase the PyCaret and Pandas Profiling tools, which allow both data scientists and beginners to streamline their machine learning workflows with just a few lines of code. The focus is on automating processes and accelerating model development, all while producing meaningful insights.
